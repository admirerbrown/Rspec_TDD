<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Practice Test Driven Development(TDD) <a name="about-project"></a>

>In this project you will implement a class with some methods, but you will do it by doing test-driven development (TDD). Remember that the idea is to write tests first and then the code.
#Project requirements
>- Create a class called Solver.
Create a method called factorial that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns the factorial for that number. The factorial is the multiplication of all integers from 1 to N and has the special case that the factorial of 0 is 1. This method only accepts 0 and positive integers, so if a negative integer is given it should raise an exception.
Create a method called reverse that takes one argument, a string word, and returns word reversed (e.g. if word is "hello" it returns "olleh").
>- Create a method called fizzbuzz that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed following these rules:
When N is divisible by 3, return "fizz".
When N is divisible by 5, return "buzz".
When N is divisible by 3 and 5, return "fizzbuzz".
Any other case, return N as a string (e.g. say N is 7 then return "7").
Remember to start with tests for all of the methods described above. Your commit history should prove that you have used TDD.
